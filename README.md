# ChippySquared Portfolio Platformer

This is a browser-based 2D platformer interactive porftolio to add to my CV. Basically, you're inside a pixel-style house
where you can walk up to certain objects like a desk and bookshelf to find information.

The instructions to play are easy to follow: 
- On **Desktop**, click the cursor to navigate.
- On **Mobile**, touch anywhere on the screen to move.

## Deployment

You can access the live preview here: [ChippySquared Portfolio](https://chippysquared.github.io/)

## Features

- **Interactive Elements**: You interact with objects in the environment to reveal details.
- **Dynamic Experience**: Combines a game-like experience with portfolio presentation, responsive controls, and fast loading times.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for browsers on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: The basic structuring and styling of the platform.
- **JavaScript**: For game dynamics and logic.
- **Vite**: It's a streamlined development environment.
